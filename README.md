At the layout analysis level, the existing data sets generally have the problem of too coarse semantic granularity. Most mainstream annotation schemes focus on the positioning of basic layout elements (such as text blocks, tables, and graphics), but ignore the division of the internal hierarchical structure of documents. This defect directly leads to the fact that the generated information is difficult to meet the needs of high-level applications such as directory construction and knowledge map generation. To address this limitation, we propose a fine-grained annotation system, based on which we complete a total of 236,790 paragraph level annotations on 14,481 pages, and explicitly record the logical reading order of each element of the layout to retain its hierarchical information.

In terms of text line detection and recognition, the error accumulation effect of the traditional multi-stage pipeline architecture has become a bottleneck restricting the development of technology. Especially when dealing with documents containing mathematical formulas and special symbols, the separation of character segmentation and semantic understanding will significantly reduce the recognition accuracy. This study proposes a line level end-to-end deep learning framework that regards embedded formulas and their surrounding conventional text as a unified semantic unit. Based on the 198,901 text paragraphs of the previous layout analysis, 340890 line level annotations have been further completed, and a segment line two-level joint annotation dataset has been constructed. In addition, we have supplemented 8,000 handwritten mathematical formulas with an average sequence length of 63, 18,717 printed mathematical formulas with a sequence length of 64-512, 26,849 single line formula text unified recognition annotation dataset, and 1169 table datasets extracted from papers.

With the wide application of deep learning technology in the field of document understanding, it has gradually become a trend to build a unified and shared data set to achieve the collaborative development of upstream and downstream tasks. On the one hand, the shared dataset ensures the consistency of data distribution and annotation standards for different tasks. On the other hand, by constructing multi-level annotations such as layout structure, text line detection and recognition, and table recognition on a single sample at the same time, the in-depth information complementation and feature sharing between tasks are realized. Unione dataset is built based on this concept.
